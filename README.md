# Overview

  

## Supply and Demand Analysis

One of the biggest challenges facing efforts to scale up COVID-19 vaccination globally has been supply; there simply have not been enough vaccines to meet the overwhelming global demand.

That dynamic is changing quickly with supply set to outstrip demand for vaccines in G7 countries.

This analysis uses supply forecast and donations data from Airfinity, combined with data on vaccine doses administered and people fully immunised from Our World In Data.

The latest date of the analysis may vary per G7 country. The analysis was last reviewed in late July 2021 and be reviewed periodically to take into account new supply forecasts and changes to vaccination trends.

  
  

### Estimating Incoming Supply

Supply figures (observed and forecast) are provided by Airfinity. Supply forecasts are based on procured doses and on Airfinity's estimates of production capacity for each vaccine.

In some cases, Airfinity's estimates for deliveries before the end 2021 are lower than country's announcements. This is the case with the US and Pfizer, where current production capacity is not enough for all the procured doses that are supposed to be delivered this year.

Even though Airfinity forecasts deliveries based on production capacity, our US analysis excludes supply forecasts of the Sanofi/GSK and Novavax vaccines, which are yet to be approved. 
  

### Estimating Existing Demand

Estimating demand is not a simple exercise. Over the first few months of the year, demand far exceeded supply and vaccination was mostly limited to key groups of people. At the time, projections of vaccine doses administered were constrained by the available supply.

In many wealthy countries, supply is no longer dictating the pace of vaccinations. Instead, countries are facing other types of challenges, including vaccine hesitancy, summer holidays, etc.

For this analysis, we based our demand projections on the number of doses administered over the latest 14-day period (per vaccine type). We assume this demand to be linear and continue indefinitely (up to a full population coverage).

In some cases, our linear demand assumption may prove optimistic, and in some cases less so.
- Vaccination data in countries like the US or UK has shown that the higher the vaccination rate, the slower the pace of increase. In other words, it gets harder and harder to reach those willing to get vaccinated.

- On the other hand, taking recent data may in some cases underestimate the potential for demand to increase rapidly in response to policy changes. Recent announcements about restrictions for the unvaccinated have massively increased demand in France, for example. Italy has recently announced similar measures, and other European countries could follow.

  
### Dose Donations

Donation figures are provided by Airfinity. This data differentiates between pledges (like the US pledging over half a billion doses) and confirmed donations. The data also tracks the number of doses that have been effectively delivered.

Data on donations can change very quickly and it relies on media or government reporting. It should therefore be interpreted with caution for a specific date.

Projected dose donations for August - December 2021 are based on already-made pledges. The rhythm of those projections is estimated by ONE based on available intel.

### Unused Doses Methodology

  
Generally, to calculate unused doses by a certain date, we take the following steps. Any variations to this methodology are explained in the country-specific briefings:

1. Estimate how many doses the country has received (and/or will) by a specific date

2. Estimate how many doses have been used (and/or will) by a specific date, should vaccinations continue at the same rate as now (latest 14-day period)

3. Estimate how many doses the country has donated (and/or will, based actual or projected deliveries) by a specific date.

4. Estimate how many unused or excess doses there would be by a specific date, calculated as:<br>
